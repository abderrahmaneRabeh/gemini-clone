# Gemini Clone using React and Gemini API

This is a clone of the Gemini AI Chatbot demo using React and the Gemini API.

Please note that this is just a simple clone and does not include all the features of the original Gemini demo.

You can try it out by running `npm run dev` and then going to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
